$h3 About ![icon](images/icon_32.png)

Coming soon...

**Note:** the API is currently unstable as we approach our [first milestone](https://github.com/llorllale/${project.artifactId}/milestone/1).

For bugs or enhancements, please use our [issue tracker](${project.url}/issues).

$h4 Why another GitHub-releases plugin?

* Travis doesn't provide adequate support for release descriptions (aka changelog), see [1](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/8568), [2](https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/issues/155), [3](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6423), [4](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/releases)
* Ability to specify parameters from the command line or `settings.xml`. This allows dynamic deployments, free from the static configuration of your project's POM.
* Project activity (there are very few projects and they're basically dead)
